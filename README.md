# Challenge-4_Quizzard

## DESCRIPTION

- This is a quiz application with questions pertaining to Javascript and traversing the DOM. It contains ten questions, that will initiate upon selection of the start button located on the landing page. I put a lot of work into this, and it's still incomplete. There is a working timer that is linked to the start of the quiz, but there is still some missing functionality pertaining to local storage for high score keeping and decrementing the timer on an incorrect answer key. But hey, I'm still learnng and this is really difficult. I gave it my best shot and will contiune to iterate on the project.

## Installation

- If you're reading this, that means you already have access to the code pushed to git

- However, if it looks like there is something we missed or could improve upon, feel free to clone our repository by clicking the green 'clone' button on the git, and copying the SSH key from the drop down menu. Once you've copied the SSH key you will need to go into your terminal and type 'git clone', paste the key, and hit enter.

  - Congrats! You've successfully made a working directory! This allows you to make alterations/additions to our code on your own local device.

## Usage

- The user will be presented with a landing page, in which they will find a container with a button labeled "Generate Password". Once the user clicks the button they will be presented with a window prompt, asking them to insert the desired amount of characters in their password, from 8 to 128. After, the user will be presented with four different confirmation windows containing prompts, confirming the inclusion of character case, numbers, and special characters.

## Credits

- I would like to thank all the teaching staff, my classmates, and Al Gore, without whom none of this would have been possible
